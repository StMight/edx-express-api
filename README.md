# CSV to JSON Converter

Edx assigment for project CSV to JSON Converter

## Answers

1.  Walk us through the design of your project. Why did you design your project the way you did? What difficulties did you overcome? - I basically just used csvtojson package at first I initialize the converter, then create new folder and at the end use filestream to read from the csv file and via pipe write the result to json file.

2.  How did you test your project to verify that it works? - I run the code and get the json result file validated via this online tool (jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com)

3.  Let us know if anything doesn't work as intended so your reviewer will know ahead of time. - everuthing seems to be working as it should :)
